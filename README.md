At the botton of this readme you can find the [initial information](##Initial-Info) shared throuhg the Nuwe platform[bottom]. [Train data set](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Access_Project_Hackathon_ITA_Decathlon/blob/main/Initial%20Docs/train.csv) and [Test data set](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Access_Project_Hackathon_ITA_Decathlon/blob/main/Initial%20Docs/test.csv) without the diagnosis/label column are in the initial Docs folder in this repository.
    
## Methodology

1. Inferential Statistics.
2. Exploratory, Analysis and manipulation of initial Data.
3. Screening classification by machine Learning.
4. Tunning of hyperparameters to optimize the chosen model.
5. Predict the status for the test data set (supplied without label) with the optimised model.
